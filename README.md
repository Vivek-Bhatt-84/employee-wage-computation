### **Use-case 1: Check Employee Attendance (Present or Absent)**
In this use-case, the program checks the employee's attendance for each working day within the month (usually 20 days). The attendance is randomly generated, where:
- If the result is `1`, the employee is **present**.
- If the result is `0`, the employee is **absent**.
