# employee-wage-computation

## master branch
 - created employeeWage.cpp and added .gitignore file .

 
### **Use-case 1: Check Employee Attendance (Present or Absent)**

- **Wage Per Hour**: â‚¹20
- **Full Day Working Hours**: 8 hours
- **part-time Working Hours**: < 4 hours


### **Use-case 4: Solve using switch case**
- In this use-case, code is refactored and solved using `switch-case` 


### **Use-case 5: Calculating Wages for a Month**

- Calculate Wages till a condition of total working hours or days is reached for a month .
- Assume `100` hours and `20` days .



### **Use-case 7: Reafector the code in classes and class variables**
